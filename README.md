# 🏥 HealthQ: AI-Powered Hospital Queue and Resource Management System

## 📋 Overview
HealthQ is an intelligent hospital management system that leverages AI to optimize patient flow, predict wait times, and manage hospital resources efficiently. The system helps reduce waiting times, improve resource allocation, and enhance overall patient experience.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Wait Time Prediction
- Real-time prediction of patient wait times
- Uses machine learning (Random Forest) to analyze:
  - Department load
  - Patient condition
  - Emergency situations
  - Symptoms
- Continuously improves predictions based on historical data

### 2. Smart Bed Management
- Real-time bed availability tracking
- Predictive analytics for bed allocation
- Historical discharge pattern analysis
- Department-wise bed utilization statistics

### 3. Queue Management
- Digital queue system for OPD
- Priority-based queue management
- Real-time queue updates
- Estimated wait time display

### 4. Resource Optimization
- Department-wise resource allocation
- Staff scheduling assistance
- Equipment utilization tracking
- Emergency resource planning

### 5. City-Wide Integration
- Unified dashboard for multiple hospitals across the city
- Inter-hospital resource coordination and referral management
- Centralized monitoring of OPD queues, bed occupancy, and emergency capacity
- Scalable architecture for expansion across urban healthcare networks

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyasaraf01/healthQ.git
cd healthQ
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

7. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## 📊 AI Model Training

The system includes an AI model for wait time prediction. To train the model:

1. Navigate to the AI module:
```bash
cd hospital/ai
```

2. Run the training script:
```bash
python ai_model.py
```

The model will be automatically trained on historical data and saved for future predictions.

## 🌟 Future Scope

- Advanced predictive analytics
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time monitoring
